# ZanskarBot

It's a chatbot made in rivescript and Javascript and is designed for students of my hostel Zanskar at IIT Delhi. 

It's hosted currently at <a href = "https://sanjay-sopho.github.io/ZanskarBot/">ZanskarBot</a>

Usage is simple. 
1. You can ask information of any representative or secretary.
2. You can ask what's in mess today. It'll tell you the next meal(In progress).
3. You can talk about general stuff.
